    Overview:

        Shader program 'samogonki':
            Get shader desc: samogonki_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs

                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t

            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'fs_params':
                    C struct: fs_params_t

                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT

    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader samogonki = sg_make_shader(samogonki_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_pos] = { ... },

                    [ATTR_vs_uv0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_texture_1 = 0;
        SLOT_texture_2 = 1;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .projection_matrix = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fs_params':

        fs_params_t fs_params = {
            .color_operation_1 = ...;
            .color_operation_2 = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_fs_params, &SG_RANGE(fs_params));
